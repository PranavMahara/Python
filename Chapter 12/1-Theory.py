# When we write programs in python for real life applications, there are many constraints on the values which the 
# variables can take in the program. For example, age cannot have a negative value. When a person inputs a 
# negative value for age, the program should show an error message. But these types of constraints cannot be 
# applied in the python programs automatically. To handle these types of errors and force constraints on values, 
# we use user defined exceptions in python.


# User defined exceptions in python are created by programmers to enforce constraints on the values which the 
# variables in the program can take. Python has many built in exceptions which are raised when there is some 
# error in the program. A program automatically terminates after showing which inbuilt exception has occurred 
# while executing the program when it reaches into an undesired state. We can stop the program from entering 
# into an undesired state by enforcing constraints using user defined exceptions.
