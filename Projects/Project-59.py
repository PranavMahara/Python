# Write a Python program to find the roots of a quadratic function. Go to the editor

# Expected Output :

# Quadratic function : (a * x^2) + b*x + c                                
# a: 25                                                                   
# b: 64                                                                   
# c: 36                                                                   
# There are 2 roots: -0.834579 and -1.725421
