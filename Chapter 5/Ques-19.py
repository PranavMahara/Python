# A	proctor	of	our	university	wants	a	student	to	write		a	program	that	calculates	the	
# average	of	marks	scored	by	her	wards	in	CAT1.	She	has	the	details	such as	name,	
# register	number,	mark1,	mark2	and	mark3	of	her	proctees.	The	constraint	given	
# by	the	faculty	is	that	any	of	the	details	must	not	be	altered	by	mistake.	Help	the	
# student	to	develop	a	Python	program.
